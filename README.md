# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python 🦠📊

This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data using Python. It aims to uncover trends, visualize key metrics, and derive insights from global pandemic datasets.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Load and preprocess real-world COVID-19 data.
- Visualize confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across countries and over time.
- Analyze trends like case growth, mortality rate, and recovery rate.
- Perform country-wise comparisons and daily progression tracking.
- Generate insightful plots to understand the pandemic’s spread and impact.

## 📁 File

- `covid19 data analysis notebook.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, visualizations, and commentary.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- **Pandas** – for data wrangling
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for plotting and data visualization
- **Plotly (optional)** – for interactive graphs
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding

## 📊 Key Features

- Load global COVID-19 datasets (CSV format assumed).
- Clean and structure time-series and country-level data.
- Plot:
  - Total cases, deaths, recoveries over time
  - Daily new cases and fatalities
  - Country-wise comparisons (e.g., India vs. USA vs. Italy)
  - Mortality and recovery rates
- Identify pandemic waves, peak periods, and flattening trends.
